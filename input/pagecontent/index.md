# CardX: Hypertension Management

## The Challenge

Hypertension affects 115 million adults in America. 85% of African- Americans will develop hypertension in their lifetime. However, there is a lack of adherence to clinical guidelines to diagnose, treat, and manage hypertension. Over 30% of people do not know that they have hypertension and only 25% of patients with a diagnosis of hypertension achieve blood pressure control.

Home blood pressure monitoring is the standard for hypertension monitoring, but there are no standards for interoperability to capture and exchange data from home blood pressure monitoring, the health system, and a personal health record.

## CardX Use Case

The goal of this use case is to create an integrated standard that enables interoperable, scalable, and accessible hypertension management both at home and in the clinic. We aim to define the methodology to enable data liquidity between home blood pressure measurement devices, patient data managers, and health systems.

This can potentially improve the awareness of guidelines, identification of disease, and management of individuals with hypertension and increase the proportion of individuals with hypertension who are treated to goal.

An example of a patient journey and use case for this implementation guide is on [Use Cases](use-cases.md).
